t3_h13fs6,BLM Donated Money is not going to Black Communities but rather to the pockets of Leftist Political Candidates!,"
1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.
2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&amp;cmte=C00401224
*‚¨ÜÔ∏è This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click ‚ÄúExpenditures‚Äù.
6- Scroll down until you see ‚ÄúTop Vendors/Recipients‚Äù.

So if for some reason you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards ‚ÄúBernie for President‚Äù and Biden‚Äôs campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Feel free to correct me if I missed something...

t3_gd0psi,Thank god I found you.,"Hey guys. I am Black, a teacher, a gun owner and a Christian . I got into reddit for the memes and I quickly realized that reddit is a crazy leftwing echo chamber. People post crazy leftist (wrong) information and will downvote or ban anyone who happens to have a different opinion. I have no karma because I refuse to buy into the crazy. I just wanted to post here in hopes I can get rolling. Epstein didn't kill himself, corona came from china and is not as bad as the msm wants us to think, an unborn baby is a life on its own, if you want health insurance work for it. No one owes you anything, no matter how many likes you get.


Edit: Hello my leftist friends. I am a nerd and love Star Trek. Anyone who does not think socialism is a wonderful idea is selfish or just an ass hole. But people are shitty. Not all of them , but most of them. So it will not work because of that. I get it. I left college super brain washed and worked construction for a long time. The whole time I felt cheated because I was doing all the work and the company owner was making the money. ""Nobody cares. Work harder"". What I didn't understand is that the owner also works hard, and was there first. I started working harder and now am in a good place in life. So please before you try to sell me some "" My sales tax on gum is the reason you can have anything"" please understand I have been there. Again ""Nobody Cares. Work Harder""",1090,0

t3_hce0kx,"Why I, a black teenager, don't agree with black lives matter","Before people spam ""whitewashed"", I wanna make it clear that this isn't just gonna be some trash racist post

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

t3_12go74,/r/Republican Has Been Hijacked By Liberals,"Why is it that the liberals won't even allow us (republicans, conservatives) to have a voice on reddit. Every single thing that gets posted gets downvoted severely by liberals, including the comments within. This is the REPUBLICAN subreddit. If you are a liberal and you are in here - you are going to agree with NOTHING.

I have NEVER been to the /r/liberal subreddit - because I know there is very little that I will agree with there, and I have enough respect for differing opinions to leave them alone on their own subreddit.

The ENTIRE /r/Politics subreddit is completely overrun by liberal Bias. Maybe if /r/politics wasn't a liberal circle-jerk, liberals could argue in the general politics section and would not have to come to /r/republican to find things to disagree with.

I would imagine that the number of republicans on Reddit is dropping by the day as a result of every subreddit being overrun with liberal downvotes. It's a sad day when they hive mind of Reddit drives away all voices of opposition.

Liberals - is this what you want? You want all of reddit to be /r/circlejerk for your political views?

Republicans - share with us some sites where you go to have intelligent political conversation that is not overrun by sneering, runny nose liberals that only want to squelch opposition through power in numbers and not through actual debate.

If you are a republican reading the comments, you'll probably have to click the plus signs next to them, as the liberals in here are downvoting our republican ideas and opinions below the comment threshold in every thread.

:::: Edit to point out that I've received so many liberal downvotes while only posting in /r/republican that I have restrictions on my commenting now. It makes me wait 10+ minutes to make a COMMENT now :::::

Brace yourselves for downvotes now that this is at the top of the /r/republican front page. It was fun while it lasted.

Riverside County Superior Court judge Helios Hernandez, appointed by Democrat governor Gray Davis, ordered [624](http://theievoice.com/there-was-so-much-wiretapping-in-riverside-county-even-the-bugs-had-bugs/) wiretaps in 2014, [almost](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/) five times more than any other American judge, and 44,000 people and over 2 million conversations were tapped. Hernandez even [got 17 wiretap applications](http://www.prosecutorialaccountability.com/2016/03/03/ca-riverside-countys-massive-wiretapping-binge-faces-its-first-court-challenge/) in one day. Some of Hernandez‚Äôs wiretaps [have been found to be illegal by prosecutors](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/08492533071/dea-loses-big-drug-case-thanks-to-illegal-wiretap-warrants-prosecutor-calls-procedural-errors.shtml), leading to the dropping of some cases and the surrender of assets seized by the feds. A [federal judge said](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2016/07/06/riverside-county-wiretaps-judge/86779116/) legal standards ‚Äúcould not have been met‚Äù with regard to the Riverside County wiretaps.

The wiretapping scheme coincided with a period of massive revenue gains for the state of California from civil asset forfeitures overseen by Kamala Harris‚Äô office. In 2014, Riverside County [collected more than $3 million](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/publications/asset_forf/2014_af/counties-2014.pdf) in civil asset forfeitures.",498,0

I don‚Äôt think that most people realize that ~1/2 of all the cases in the country are coming out of New York City and its surroundings. Besides a few other urban centers, COVID-19 is not spreading uncontrollably fast here. Trump has also freed up billions of dollars towards the recovery effort both medically and economically through the recently passed stimulus package, and the declaration of a national emergency *two weeks ago*. Navy hospital ships have also been docked at various ports across the country. Diagnostic tests are also becoming readily available (there‚Äôs a drive-thru to get tested near my house) The ratio of sick to healthy in the USA is a lot better than most European nations. Per 1,000,000 people in America, 250 are ill. Compare that with Italy (1M:1,400) Spain (1M:1,350) Switzerland (1M:1,500) and Germany (1M:600) and many others. A week and a half ago the media was bashing Trump for fear mongering and being to harsh, but now they‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs not doing shit. Many companies based here have also taken tremendous precautions to keep people and their employees distanced and healthy. Contrary to what some may think, an entire nation with 325 million people can‚Äôt just take a 3 month holiday and expect everything to be normal once it ends. Though the CDC and the president have made a few bad decisions, they are still doing their job to the best of their ability, and Trump‚Äôs latest approval rating shows that (highest point in his presidency thus far)",479,0

I used my frist time ever voting to vote for Obama... oh boy did i learn my lessonüò©.. when Trump first announced i was sceptical about him. I was set in my blue ways and i didn't vote in 2016. No way in the world i was voting for the other personüòí. But after years of Trump winning and listening to many conservative speech's and reasoning sold me. Great speakers like Ben Shapiro, and the rest opened my eyes to see what was reallyb going on.. After years of being brainwashed by the left and being set in their ways of believing the red side was pure evil is over. I can honestly say I'm proud to vote for my president again and give him a another term. Even though I know my vote will be destroyed by my state of NY by the left. I'm still giving my support to Trump. Thanks for listening  guys

Side note: my mother also converted to the red.. we are the only ones in our family who debate the rest of our family who are still brain washed and still believe that the left is looking out for them",372,0
